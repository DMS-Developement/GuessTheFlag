Guess the Flag

This project is a delve into exploring how buttons, alerts, and design modifiers work in SwiftUI.
We have a game that randomly shuffles an array of countries, displays Images based off of the first three countries in the array, allows a user to select one, a popup will show telling the user if they are right or wrong and then incrementing their score up by one if correct.
